# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenMed will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added a PEP 561 `py.typed` marker plus a pinned, scoped mypy gate for the
  annotated public-module surface, with built-wheel and sdist verification
  that the marker ships in release artifacts (#548).
- Added a full Korean (`ko`) PII language pack with native date, phone, RRN,
  postcode, and address patterns, checksum-valid local surrogates, synthetic
  golden coverage, service and training wiring, and the manifest-backed Korean
  default model (#262).
- Added an offline immunization zero-shot domain with FHIR-aligned display
  labels, canonical policy metadata, synthetic per-label fixture coverage, and
  generated OM-138 exporter-alignment documentation (#897).

## [1.8.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Fixed automatic PyTorch attention selection so `auto` no longer forces SDPA onto Transformers architectures that do not support it, including `DebertaV2ForTokenClassification`; explicit `eager`, `sdpa`, and `flash_attention_2` selections remain available.
- Changed unavailable accelerated-attention fallbacks to use the architecture-independent eager implementation instead of selecting another accelerated backend from runtime capability alone.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-09

This release summarizes the cross-platform runtime, service hardening, multimodal privacy, clinical extraction, and release-evidence work merged after `v1.7.0`. The reviewed range is broad: 434 commits from `v1.7.0` through the final `release/openmed-180` branch tip prepared for the `v1.8.0` tag, covering Android, browser, and React Native runtimes, production service controls, structured health-data pipelines, and the privacy/evaluation gates that keep those surfaces aligned.

### Added

- Added the Android OpenMedKit surface: a Gradle project, Kotlin public API, token-classification decoder, ONNX and ORT Mobile paths, ML Kit OCR adapter, model catalog/download cache, document/image intake, Compose demo, scan demo, Python-to-Android span parity fixtures, Android CI, and guarded Maven Central publishing (#1114, #1115, #1116, #1117, #1118, #1119, #1120, #1121, #1122, #1123, #1124, #1146, #1148, #1149, #1150, #1155, #1156, #1161, #1162).
- Added browser, mobile JavaScript, and cross-platform client runtimes, including a typed OpenMedKit web package for Transformers.js/ONNX Runtime Web, a React Native bridge, Swift-Kotlin parity checks, public API parity coverage, and a typed TypeScript service client surface (#1132, #1177, #1178, #1123).
- Added production service and deployment capabilities: API-key/JWT auth, request correlation IDs, no-PHI JSON logging, OpenTelemetry tracing, gRPC, async jobs and webhooks, Helm deployment, multi-arch containers, circuit breakers, model-load retry/backoff, privacy-gateway redaction before external calls, SMART-on-FHIR bulk ingestion, object-storage batch runs, Spark/Dask/lakehouse/columnar redaction, DuckDB and pandas/polars accessors, agent/MCP tool orchestration, hardened distroless images, image signing, SLSA provenance, container SBOMs, and vulnerability scanning (#1080, #1081, #1082, #1084, #1109, #1110, #1126, #1127, #1129, #1130, #1131, #1133, #1136, #1138, #1139, #1140, #1141, #1143, #1144, #1152, #1153, #1154, #1175, #1176, #1179, #1180, #1185, #1189).
- Added deeper clinical extraction and interoperability: normalized clinical timelines, document assertion graphs, clinical event frames, medication relation decoding, concept normalization, UCUM units, free vocabulary grounding, RxNorm/ICD-10-CM/HPO linkers, CodeableConcept export, deterministic CDM extraction, OMOP CDM loader foundation, GDPR DSAR export, and severity/laterality, clinical-genomics, gastroenterology, endocrinology, nutrition/diet, and anesthesia domain coverage (#1019, #1022, #1025, #1026, #1027, #1079, #1086, #1105, #1134, #1135, #1137, #1160, #1164, #1165, #1166, #1167, #1170, #1182, #1183, #1184, #1187, #1219, #1292, #1299).
- Added multimodal and structured privacy coverage for DOCX offset extraction, plain-image redaction, DICOM header de-identification, burned-in DICOM pixel OCR redaction, redacted-PDF text-layer fidelity checks, EPUB extraction, vCard/iCalendar PHI redaction, UK health identifiers, IBAN/SWIFT/BIC identifiers, passport/MRZ validation, and additional validator-backed ID packs for Slovak, Latvian, Malay, Filipino, and Danish locales (#1093, #1098, #1106, #1107, #1108, #1112, #1128, #1142, #1163, #1171, #1173, #1186, #1188, #1406).
- Added evaluation, model, and release evidence infrastructure: streaming token classification, speculative MLX PII decoding, QLoRA smoke recipes, leakage-weighted distillation, Core ML and ONNX optimization/parity gates, OpenVINO export, paged KV-cache attention, memory-budgeted model scheduling, benchmark ledgers, active-learning gate queues, hard-negative mining, cross-lingual transfer evaluation, model-card/datasheet generation, flakiness quarantine, conformal calibration and abstention, mobile performance benchmarking, comparator matrices, load-test harnesses, and training provenance reproducibility gates (#1002, #1003, #1009, #1014, #1015, #1016, #1017, #1018, #1036, #1054, #1055, #1056, #1062, #1063, #1064, #1065, #1066, #1097, #1113, #1147, #1151, #1172, #1220).
- Added an endocrinology zero-shot domain for glycemic and thyroid-function
  measures, hormone levels, insulin regimens, metabolic findings, and endocrine
  glands, with canonical label normalization, keyword routing metadata, and
  synthetic fixture coverage (#895).
- Added `examples/gradio_deid_app.py`, an interactive Gradio demo that runs
  `deidentify` over synthetic text with a `mask`/`replace`/`hash` method
  selector and shows the redacted output alongside the detected PII entities.
  `gradio` stays an optional, example-local dependency with a graceful install
  hint, and the example is covered by import-safe smoke tests (#484).
- Added an `OPENMED_MLX_MMAP` toggle to `openmed.mlx.models.load_model`:
  safetensors weights load through MLX's memory-mapped, lazy path by default
  (keeping cold-start peak RSS low on the phone/laptop tiers), with
  `OPENMED_MLX_MMAP=0` forcing eager materialization as a documented fallback
  for debugging (#296).

### Changed

- Extended OpenMed from a Python/Swift-centered toolkit into a coordinated Python, Swift, Kotlin/Android, TypeScript, React Native, browser, REST, gRPC, and deployment release, with parity tests and shared fixtures keeping the platform surfaces aligned.
- Updated release engineering around guarded PyPI publishing, SLSA attestations, SBOMs, signed images, static OpenAPI regeneration, reproducible release metadata, baseline-aware secret scanning, and guarded mobile/container publishing so library, container, and mobile artifacts can be validated from the same source tree (#1104, #1144, #1153, #1154, #1405).

### Fixed

- Fixed optimizer-stripped assertions, explicit UTF-8 handling, JSON decoding failures, exception chaining, iOS MLX pinning, multilingual test span offsets, Pages deployment concurrency, HPO linker test adaptation, DSAR vault-key matching, and lint cleanup after the large v1.8 merge train (#1091, #1094, #1095, #1096, #1100, #1158, #1181, #1194, #1404).

### Security

- Added and strengthened no-raw-PHI logging, offline mode socket blocking, privacy-gateway redaction before external LLM calls, policy compiler coverage proofs, DP surrogate budgeting, k-anonymity/l-diversity/t-closeness enforcement, membership-inference defenses, adversarial de-identification robustness, federated leakage evaluation, secret scanning, pre-commit hook scanning, and vulnerability gates (#189, #190, #1034, #1035, #1037, #1043, #1047, #1082, #1127, #1141, #1405).

  pipeline explain traces, section stamping, and per-document risk budgets
  (#706, #695, #729, #704, #778, #779, #731, #611, #727, #785, #733).
- Added CLI surfaces for policy-aware `openmed deid`, `openmed fhir bundle`,

  (#632, #630, #750, #742, #722, #788, #789, #756).
- Added an in-process ASGI load-test harness with configurable concurrency

  #703, #702, #708, #725, #680, #724, #723, #740, #735, #681, #682, #752,
  #753, #754, #762, #765, #734, #764, #744, #786).
- Added model, backend, and training support for Laneformer MLX-LM, MLX INT4
  recall certification, Core ML INT8 palettized export, AWQ and GPTQ 4-bit
  quantization recipes, bitsandbytes 4-bit loading, FlashAttention/SDPA/eager
  attention selection, PyTorch MPS tuning, ONNX/WebGPU and Transformers.js
  exports, tokenizer caching, Mode-A distillation, DAPT corpus assembly, and
  ONNX/quantized artifact publishing metadata (#644, #620, #619, #627, #759,
  #760, #761, #719, #736, #790, #751, #622, #612).
- Added interop adapters for PHILTER, pyDeid, GLiNER-BioMed, LangChain, and the

  release status contracts (#628, #694, #647, #716, #720, #1021, #409, #697).

### Changed

- `analyze_text(..., output_format="dict")` now returns a frozen
  `AnalyzeResult`; `to_dict()` and mapping access preserve the legacy dict shape
  (#611).
- PII extraction and the staged pipeline now apply clinical term protection by
  default, suppressing ambiguous PERSON/LOCATION/ORG matches that exactly match
  protected clinical vocabulary (#698).
- ConText temporality, uncertainty, and negation now use sentence/clause-bounded
  cue scope with section-aware priors and context offsets (#738, #739, #782).
- Pipeline span output can include populated `section` metadata after section
  stamping (#785).
- Lab reference-range parsing now accepts broader separators/operators and treats
  unknown explicit flags as `unknown` rather than deriving a normal/high/low
  result (#560).
- REST `/health` remains as a compatibility alias, while `/livez` and `/readyz`
  expose split liveness/readiness state and shutdown drains in-flight
  model-backed requests (#722).
- REST CORS and trusted-host handling is now deny-by-default except for exact
  configured origins and trusted hosts (#686).
- OCR auto-selection can now pick installed EasyOCR or docTR adapters in
  addition to Tesseract/PaddleOCR (#749, #558).
- Evaluation defaults now include DrugProt and biomedical NER suites, and
  leakage heatmaps now emit label-by-language matrices with totals and worst
  cells (#617, #743, #680).
- Model manifest rows now merge format lists for existing repositories and
  recognize ONNX/WebGPU and Transformers.js export formats (#736, #790).
- CI lint/test/security/build setup moved to `uv sync` / `uv run`, with GitHub
  Actions refs validated and Dependabot Actions updates limited to minor/patch
  bumps (#185, #700).
- PyTorch/HF backends can auto-select MPS on Apple Silicon when no device is set
  (#719).
- AWQ and GPTQ export paths now share synthetic quantization calibration
  metadata (#759).
- `shift_dates` documentation now describes patient-keyed stable date shifting;
  the legacy boolean remains accepted but deprecated in favor of
  `method="shift_dates"` (#704).

### Fixed

- Fixed nondeterministic audit span ordering so report serialization, hashes, and
  signatures are stable while preserving legacy verification (#645).
- Fixed date-shift parity between `python-dateutil` and fallback paths,
  including month-first English month-name dates, and aligned `uv.lock` with the
  dev extra dependency set (#616, #649).
- Fixed deterministic FHIR URN preservation during Bundle assembly (#553).
- Fixed JSON loading paths in core, eval, NER, and risk modules so corrupt JSON
  raises clearer errors or fails closed (#958).
- Fixed optional-extra diagnostics for missing `ftfy`, section detection, and
  date-shift capabilities (#781).
- Reduced numeric false positives in safety-sweep postcode-style matches by
  requiring stronger context (#783).
- Added explicit UTF-8 encodings for subprocess/file I/O paths and preserved
  exception chaining in model load failures (#1088).
- Added timeouts to `subprocess.run` calls in reproducibility hash and
  release-gate issue helpers (#1090).
- Replaced eager f-string logging with lazy logging interpolation across model,
  processing, batch, text, and utility modules (#1092).
- Fixed PII method quickstart docs for `mask`, `remove`, `replace`, `hash`,
  `shift_dates`, and `reidentify()` examples (#409).

### Security

- Added root `SECURITY.md`, private vulnerability disclosure guidance, security
  issue-template routing, security docs, and README links (#648).
- Added breach-notification runbook and breach report template with explicit
  no-raw-PHI/PII handling guidance (#1021).
- Added CycloneDX SBOM generation via `make sbom`, CI artifact upload, tagged
  release SBOM attachment, and supply-chain docs (#720).
- Added reproducible-lock GitHub Actions gate and contributing docs for pinned,
  hash-verified installs (#1083).
- Added lockfile drift, GitHub Actions ref, license-policy, and doctest-backed
  public-example gates (#693, #700, #763).
- Added PHI-safe defaults for progress callbacks, NDJSON error summaries,
  active-learning records, hashed examples, explain traces, dataset cards, and
  metadata scrubbing (#621, #737, #613, #765, #727, #701, #755).

### Dependencies

- Added optional extras and dependency policy entries for multimodal/OCR, spaCy,
  AWQ, GPTQ, MLX-LM, Kafka, PHILTER/pyDeid, TypeScript client support, and
  service clients (#555, #567, #624, #627, #644, #757, #759, #372, #756, #789).
- Updated GitHub Actions refs and maintenance dependencies, including checkout
  v7, setup-python v6, cache v6, upload-artifact v7, Ruff/pre-commit updates,
  and LangChain Core 1.x compatibility for the optional LangChain extra (#607,
  #710, #711, #712, #713, #714, #715).

### Removed

- No public files, modules, or APIs were removed in the reviewed release range.

### Upgrade Notes

- FHIR `OperationOutcome` output emits R4 `issue.expression`; legacy
  `issue.location` is accepted on input but is not emitted, and non-R4
  severities such as `info` are rejected (#566).
- `ServiceRuntime.get_loader()` returns the warm-pool proxy; use
  `get_model_loader()` when raw loader access is required (#632).
- Unsupported Core ML architectures now fail before model loading/tracing, and
  `--quantized-output` requires `--quantize int8` (#619).
- Custom OCR engines should tolerate the keyword-only `languages` parameter
  (#717).
- The canonical label set expanded with clinical concepts, which can affect
  callers enumerating exact label counts (#718).
- `format_preserve` expands the action enum/schema surface and updates schema
  fingerprints (#778).
- REST deployments using custom Host headers must configure
  `OPENMED_SERVICE_TRUSTED_HOSTS`; wildcard CORS/trusted-host settings are
  rejected (#686).
- OCR auto-selection order changed when optional EasyOCR or docTR engines are
  installed (#749, #558).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Added a policy-aware de-identification runtime with canonical `OpenMedSpan` schema contracts, a ten-stage `Pipeline`, detector arbitration/cascade routing, calibrated per-label/language/policy thresholds, deterministic safety sweep backstops, and six bundled policy profiles (`hipaa_safe_harbor`, `hipaa_expert_review_assist`, `gdpr_pseudonymization`, `research_limited_dataset`, `strict_no_leak`, `clinical_minimal_redaction`).
- Added signed, reproducible de-identification audit reports with span provenance, residual-risk metadata, reproducibility hashes, and optional HMAC signatures.
- Added re-identification risk reporting and adversarial re-identification benchmark support, including `openmed benchmark pii --attack reid`.
- Added a leakage-first evaluation harness with `BenchmarkReport`, synthetic golden de-identification fixtures, public/reference dataset adapters, DUA-gated corpus stubs, SHIELD comparison-suite support, weak labeling utilities, cold-start latency, and deterministic bootstrap confidence intervals.
- Added release-gate infrastructure for v1.6.0 model readiness: last-green baselines, calibration artifacts, G1a-G8 signed gate reports, quantization recall-delta checks, generated status/leaderboard pages, and a fail-closed release-gates workflow.
- Added clinical and interoperability utilities: ConText temporality and uncertainty axes, OHDSI Athena/Usagi ingestion, a Presidio adapter, and a deterministic FHIR R4 transaction/batch Bundle assembler.
- Added a cardiology zero-shot label-map domain (`CardiacFinding`, `ECGFinding`, `EjectionFraction`, `CardiacProcedure`, `CardiacDevice`, `Anatomy`) plus cardiology keyword routing metadata for future model registration. Public model suggestions continue to fall back to existing general medical models until a cardiology model is registered.
- Added a canonical `models.jsonl` manifest, manifest refresh workflow, manifest-driven Hugging Face model card generation, and HF publishing support for converted MLX/CoreML artifacts.
- Added a packaged `openmed` CLI surface with benchmark and calibration commands, plus a de-identification cookbook notebook and an offline clinical NER families example.
- Added governance, compliance, security, device-tier, FAQ, API reference, release-channel, status, leaderboard, and notebook documentation.

### Changed

- `deidentify()` now routes through the staged policy pipeline and accepts policy, calibration, threshold, and audit controls. When `audit=True`, it returns an audit report rather than the regular `DeidentificationResult`.
- `deidentify(..., keep_mapping=True)` now emits unique placeholders for repeated entities of the same type, such as `[NAME]` and `[NAME_2]`, so re-identification round trips can distinguish them.
- Label metadata now carries policy labels, HIPAA Safe Harbor mappings, risk levels, and ID-number subtype hints while keeping canonical labels stable.
- Benchmark steady-state latency now excludes cold start while preserving `latency.cold_start_ms` in reports.
- PyPI publishing now uses a single guarded tag/manual `publish.yml` workflow; the duplicate release workflow was removed.
- Release metadata now derives changelog sections and expected SemVer bumps from Conventional Commits.
- Python linting/formatting moved to Ruff and pre-commit, Swift formatting moved to checked-in `swift-format` scripts, and CI now enforces the updated repo policy, lint, tests, security, secret-scan, Swift-format, and release-gate jobs.
- Packaging now includes the model manifest, release-gate baseline, policy/schema JSON, `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE`.

### Fixed

- Fixed `method="shift_dates"` to recognize canonical date labels before redaction, so lowercase `date` output from the default English PII model and `date_of_birth` labels are shifted instead of masked; `keep_mapping` no longer treats shifted dates as mask placeholders.
- FHIR Bundle assembly now rejects duplicate `ResourceType/id` values instead of silently overwriting the earlier resource in the internal reference map. Duplicate resources raise a `ValueError` that names the colliding key, preventing downstream references from being rewritten to the wrong Bundle entry.
- REST/MCP request schemas now accept `ar`, `ja`, and `tr` for the `lang` field. These languages have published PII models and are listed in `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`, but the `lang` `Literal` in `openmed/service/schemas.py` was never updated, so the service rejected them with a 422 even though the Python API and the models worked. The four `lang` annotations now share a single `PIILanguage` alias kept in sync with `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` (guarded by a regression test).
- Fixed case-insensitive `trust_remote_code` allowlist matching for first-party and environment-configured privacy-filter repositories.
- Fixed Feb 29 date shifting when `keep_year=True` targets a non-leap year.
- Fixed REST oversized-text handling with `OPENMED_SERVICE_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH` (default `1_000_000` characters).
- Fixed `BatchProcessor.iter_process` so `batch_size` is honored while preserving output order.
- Fixed duplicate benchmark fixture IDs, duplicate benchmark CLI registration, release-gate behavior when no candidate report is present, and repo-policy ignored-file handling.
- Fixed user-controlled HTML formatter escaping and validation false positives for legitimate long non-ASCII/CJK clinical text.
- Fixed reversible `remove` mappings and repeated entity-type re-identification round trips when `keep_mapping=True`.

### Security

- Added a protected `hf-publish` environment and `HF_WRITE_TOKEN` policy for model publishing.
- Added dependency license policy, `pip-audit` security gate with time-boxed ignores, and gitleaks CI/pre-commit secret scanning with a canary fixture.
- Hardened de-identification audit report signing so `AuditReport.sign()` and `AuditReport.verify()` require a non-empty HMAC key. `None`, empty strings, and empty byte strings now raise `ValueError` instead of producing or accepting weak signatures.

### Tests

- Added FHIR Bundle regression coverage for empty resource lists across transaction, collection, and batch Bundles, and for dangling references that should remain unchanged when the referenced resource is absent from the Bundle.

### Notes

- `shift_dates` remains available as a compatibility alias; prefer `method="shift_dates"` in new code.
- REST clients sending more than `OPENMED_SERVICE_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH` characters now receive a 422 response unless the limit is raised.
- Full SHIELD/DUA datasets require approved or user-supplied access paths; restricted corpus rows are not vendored.
- Release-gate candidates for v1.6.0 need release metadata, calibration evidence for masking/replacement profiles, span fixtures for G8, and quantization evidence for quantized formats.

## [1.5.5] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added batch PII extraction and de-identification support through `BatchProcessor(operation="extract_pii")` and `BatchProcessor(operation="deidentify")`, including document-level `batch_size` chunking, shared loader/pipeline reuse, tests, docs, and a runnable example.
- Added REST service model lifecycle controls with `GET /models/loaded`, `POST /models/unload`, request-level `keep_alive`, `OPENMED_SERVICE_KEEP_ALIVE`, and model-loader cache release helpers.
- Added chunked Swift/OpenMedKit PII extraction for long OCR text and refreshed the OpenMed Scan Demo clinical document flow with updated sample text, a printable sample PDF, and a generator script.
- Added a project mascot, brand assets in `docs/brand/`, and an animated on-device PII de-identification demo (`docs/brand/openmed-pii-demo.gif`).
- Added README translations in 13 languages with a language switcher: zh-CN, es, fr, de, it, pt, nl, ar, hi, te, ja, tr, fa.

### Changed

- Batched privacy-filter inference now accepts list inputs across Torch and MLX paths and forwards batching controls to the underlying pipelines.
- The OpenMed Scan Demo now unloads inactive MLX runtime families when switching engines, sequences selected and secondary PII engine runs explicitly, improves OCR line ordering, and expands entity category mapping.
- README and service/model-loader documentation now cover batch PII operations and model unloading behavior.
- Overhauled the README with a visual hero, brand badges, Apple Silicon/Swift/iOS entry points, an OpenMed-vs-cloud comparison table, and a Mermaid flow diagram.

### Fixed

- Improved Swift structured PII recovery for clinical discharge summaries, including surname-first names, member and insurance IDs, account/encounter/document IDs, NPI values, PCP/signed-provider sections, and overlap deduplication.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-05-27

### Security

- Hardened the privacy-filter dispatcher to refuse `trust_remote_code=True` for model identifiers outside an explicit allowlist of first-party OpenAI/OpenMed privacy-filter family models (`openai/privacy-filter`, `OpenMed/privacy-filter-multilingual`, `OpenMed/privacy-filter-nemotron`). Previously, any HuggingFace repository whose name contained the substring `privacy-filter` would be loaded with custom-code execution enabled, allowing remote code execution by anyone able to control the `model_name` parameter on `/pii/extract` or `/pii/deidentify`. Operators with custom fine-tunes of the privacy-filter family can extend the allowlist via the `OPENMED_TRUSTED_REMOTE_CODE_MODELS` environment variable (comma-separated repo IDs).
- Changed `PrivacyFilterTorchPipeline`'s `trust_remote_code` default from `True` to `False`. The first-party dispatcher (`openmed.core.backends.create_privacy_filter_pipeline`) opts in explicitly only for allowlisted models.

### Changed

- README, docs, and website version surfaces now point at `1.5.2`.

### Fixed

- Fixed raw HuggingFace-to-MLX conversion for the OpenAI Privacy Filter family (`openai/privacy-filter`, `OpenMed/privacy-filter-nemotron`, and `OpenMed/privacy-filter-multilingual`) by casting BF16 tensors to float32 before NumPy conversion, remapping OPF/Nemotron checkpoints into the OpenMed MLX runtime layout, fusing Q/K/V projections, preserving classifier bias, and validating converted weight keys/shapes before artifact save.

### Tests

- Added `tests/unit/test_privacy_filter_security.py` covering the identifier matcher, allowlist gate, env-var override, local-artifact trust, and dispatcher opt-in.
- Added HTTP-level regression tests in `tests/unit/service/test_api.py` that POST the attacker-controlled `model_name` payload to `/pii/extract` and `/pii/deidentify` and verify the privacy-filter dispatcher is never reached.
- Added MLX converter regressions for BF16 NumPy conversion, OPF weight remapping, QKV fusion order, and partial-QKV rejection.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- README, docs, website, and Apple demo version surfaces now point at `1.5.1`.
- Prepared the patch release metadata for the tag-driven build and publish workflow.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Arabic (`ar`), Japanese (`ja`), and Turkish (`tr`) PII extraction support in the Python SDK, including language defaults, localized regex patterns, fake replacement data, and anonymizer locale routing.
- Registry entries for all API-visible Arabic, Japanese, and Turkish PII source checkpoints: 2 Arabic, 3 Japanese, and 32 Turkish models.
- Preconverted MLX routing for the 28 supported Arabic, Japanese, and Turkish PII `-mlx` repositories so `OpenMedConfig(backend="mlx")` can resolve uploaded artifacts directly.
- Turkish TCKN checksum validation plus context-aware Arabic and Japanese national ID patterns.

### Changed

- README, docs, website, and Apple demo version surfaces now point at `1.5.0`.
- Faker anonymization now falls back to `en_US` with a warning if a requested locale is unavailable at runtime.

### Fixed

- Turkish street-address matching now accepts both descriptor-first forms such as `Cadde İnönü 12` and common Turkish name-first forms such as `Atatürk Caddesi 12`.

### Tests

- Added language constant/default routing, model registry count, MLX mapping, anonymizer locale, and multilingual PII regression coverage for Arabic, Japanese, and Turkish.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- README, docs, website, and Apple demo version surfaces now point at `1.4.1`.

### Fixed

- `ModelLoader` now resolves existing filesystem paths before prepending the default Hugging Face org, so local model directories load correctly.
- Local model paths now set `local_files_only=True` across config, tokenizer, model, pipeline, and max-length probing to keep offline and air-gapped inference fully local.
- `analyze_text()` now accepts `model_id` as an alias for `model_name`, including local directory paths.

### Tests

- Added unit coverage for local path resolution, local-only loading, and `model_id` alias handling.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **OpenMed Multilingual Privacy Filter family**, registered across PyTorch and MLX:
  - `OpenMed/privacy-filter-multilingual` — PyTorch / Transformers (CPU + CUDA).
  - `OpenMed/privacy-filter-multilingual-mlx` — MLX full-precision (Apple Silicon).
  - `OpenMed/privacy-filter-multilingual-mlx-8bit` — MLX 8-bit quantized (Apple Silicon and OpenMedKit demos).
  These artifacts use the OpenAI Privacy Filter architecture and officially support 16 languages through the OpenMed multilingual PII corpus.
- **Python MLX routing for multilingual Privacy Filter artifacts**:
  - `_MLX_MODEL_MAP` entries for the full and 8-bit multilingual MLX repo IDs.
  - `privacy-filter-multilingual` and `multilingual-privacy-filter` MLX family aliases, both resolving to the existing OpenAI Privacy Filter model class and BIOES decoder.
  - Family-aware Torch fallback so multilingual MLX model names substitute `OpenMed/privacy-filter-multilingual` on non-MLX hosts instead of the OpenAI baseline.
- **Multilingual Privacy Filter Studio** in `examples/privacy_filter_multilingual_studio/`, a web demo comparing the OpenAI baseline, OpenAI Nemotron Privacy Filter, and OpenMed Multilingual Privacy Filter with English, French, and Arabic examples.
- **OpenMed Scan Demo multilingual mode** with `OpenMed/privacy-filter-multilingual-mlx-8bit`, a three-engine picker, EN/FR/AR sample buttons, and new French/Arabic scanned demo documents for screenshot-ready flows.
### Changed

- Privacy Filter docs and README now describe three Privacy Filter families and label the multilingual model as **OpenMed Multilingual Privacy Filter**.
- OpenMedKit and demo version surfaces now point at `1.4.0`.
- The scan demo clears previous annotation windows whenever the language/sample changes, avoiding stale entities from earlier model runs.
- The multilingual web studio scan animation now performs a single top-to-bottom pass while redacting line by line, matching the stronger visual rhythm of the original Privacy Filter Studio.

### Fixed

- Improved Swift model-download handling so stale cached 401/404 responses cannot masquerade as `openmed-mlx.json` manifests after a public model becomes available.
- Tightened stale-result invalidation in iOS and web demo flows so slower previous model runs cannot overwrite a newly selected language/sample.

### Tests

- Added Python unit coverage for multilingual MLX backend selection, family-aware Torch fallback, and MLX Privacy Filter family dispatch aliases.
- Rebuilt the OpenMed Scan Demo after the multilingual 8-bit integration.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **Faker-backed PII anonymization engine** (`openmed.core.anonymizer`):
  - `Anonymizer` class with cached per-locale Faker instances, deterministic seeding (`hashlib.blake2b`), and label-keyed generator dispatch.
  - `AnonymizerConfig` dataclass for advanced configuration.
  - Locale resolution map (`LANG_TO_LOCALE`) covering all nine OpenMed languages; Telugu falls back to `en_IN` with a one-time `UserWarning`.
  - Format-preserving helpers for phone numbers (digit-group lengths preserved), dates (separator/ordering preserved), emails (domain preserved), and generic IDs.
  - Custom Faker providers for clinical/national IDs where Faker's built-ins are missing or incorrect: `AadhaarProvider` (Verhoeff checksum), `GermanSteuerIdProvider`, `MedicalRecordNumberProvider`, `NPIProvider`. Faker's built-ins are reused for `pt_BR.cpf`/`cnpj`, `nl_NL.ssn` (BSN), `fr_FR.ssn` (NIR), `it_IT.ssn` (Codice Fiscale), and `es_ES.nie` after empirical verification against OpenMed's existing checksum validators.
  - `register_clinical_provider()` and `register_label_generator()` for extending coverage.
- **Canonical PII label taxonomy** (`openmed.core.labels`):
  - `CANONICAL_LABELS` set with 47 canonical labels in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
  - `normalize_label()` maps English lowercase, the 52 Portuguese UPPERCASE labels, BIOES-tagged variants (`B-NAME`, `I-DATE`), and arbitrary mixed-case forms to a single canonical form.
- **Unified privacy-filter dispatch** (`openmed.core.backends`):
  - `select_privacy_filter_backend()`, `resolve_privacy_filter_model()`, and `create_privacy_filter_pipeline()` route privacy-filter requests to MLX on Apple Silicon and PyTorch elsewhere with a one-time `UserWarning` when an MLX-only artifact name (`OpenMed/privacy-filter-mlx*`) is substituted with `openai/privacy-filter` on non-Mac hosts.
  - `extract_pii()` and `deidentify()` now route privacy-filter models through this dispatcher, skipping regex smart-merging since the model already does Viterbi-constrained BIOES decoding.
- **PyTorch privacy-filter wrapper** (`openmed.torch.PrivacyFilterTorchPipeline`):
  - Loads `openai/privacy-filter` (or any compatible HuggingFace fine-tune) via `transformers.AutoModelForTokenClassification` with auto device selection (CUDA → CPU).
  - Output entity-dict shape matches the MLX pipeline so the rest of OpenMed is backend-agnostic.
- **Shared decoding utilities** (`openmed.core.decoding`):
  - `TokenLabelInfo`, `build_label_info`, `viterbi_decode`, `labels_to_token_spans`, `zero_viterbi_biases`, `VITERBI_BIAS_KEYS` extracted from the MLX pipeline so the Torch wrapper reuses the same BIOES Viterbi decoder.
  - `trim_span_whitespace`, `refine_privacy_filter_span` for span post-processing across both backends.
- **`deidentify()` keyword arguments**: `consistent: bool`, `seed: Optional[int]`, `locale: Optional[str]` for deterministic, locale-overridable obfuscation. Passing `seed=` alone implies `consistent=True`.
- **Portuguese (`pt`) accepted by REST API schemas** in `openmed/service/schemas.py` (was previously library-only despite full core support).
- **Documentation**: new [Anonymization Guide](docs/anonymization.md) covering the Faker engine, locale table, determinism modes, format preservation, clinical-ID checksum sources, and the privacy-filter family.
- **Examples**:
  - `examples/obfuscation_demo.py` — random vs deterministic surrogates, locale walkthrough, format-preserving phone numbers, pt_BR CPF generation with checksum verification.
  - `examples/privacy_filter_unified.py` — same `extract_pii()` / `deidentify()` call works on Apple Silicon (MLX) and Linux (PyTorch); compares the OpenAI baseline against the Nemotron-PII fine-tune side-by-side.
  - `examples/privacy_filter_studio/` — interactive FastAPI + static web studio for two-pane PII masking/randomization with sample clinical notes, highlighted entities, backend/model status, and an explicit first-run download toggle.
- **Nemotron-PII fine-tune of the OpenAI Privacy Filter**, registered as three new model IDs that route through the existing privacy-filter pipeline (same architecture, different training data):
  - `OpenMed/privacy-filter-nemotron` — PyTorch / Transformers (CPU + CUDA).
  - `OpenMed/privacy-filter-nemotron-mlx` — MLX full-precision (Apple Silicon).
  - `OpenMed/privacy-filter-nemotron-mlx-8bit` — MLX 8-bit quantized (Apple Silicon).
  These checkpoints **are** the OpenAI Privacy Filter architecture (gpt-oss-style sparse-MoE transformer with local attention, sink tokens, RoPE+YaRN, tiktoken `o200k_base`) fine-tuned on the [Nemotron PII dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-PII-v1). They reuse `OpenAIPrivacyFilterForTokenClassification` and `PrivacyFilterMLXPipeline` unchanged — no new architecture code needed.
- **`_MLX_MODEL_MAP` entries** for the two new Nemotron MLX repo IDs in `openmed.mlx.inference`.
- **Aliases for the new family in `_SUPPORTED_TOKEN_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_TYPES`** (`privacy-filter-nemotron`, `nemotron-privacy-filter`) — both resolve to the existing `openai-privacy-filter` family so a Nemotron-fine-tune MLX artifact can ship with either family identifier in its manifest and still dispatch correctly.
- **Family-aware Torch fallback** in `openmed.core.backends`:
  - New `_TORCH_FALLBACK_BY_FAMILY` table and `_torch_fallback_for()` helper.
  - An MLX-only Nemotron request on a non-Apple-Silicon host now substitutes `OpenMed/privacy-filter-nemotron` instead of the unrelated default `openai/privacy-filter`, so the user gets the training distribution they asked for. A one-time `UserWarning` names the substitute.
  - Adding a future fine-tune that should fall back to its own PyTorch repo is a one-line addition to `_TORCH_FALLBACK_BY_FAMILY`.
- **Nemotron MLX classifier-head bias support**: `OpenAIPrivacyFilterForTokenClassification` now honors `classifier_bias` / `unembedding_bias` in artifact configs, while keeping the original OpenAI checkpoint bias-less by default.
- **Swift OpenMedKit privacy-filter classifier-head bias support**: the native MLX artifact loader now decodes `classifier_bias` / `unembedding_bias` and builds the Privacy Filter head with a learned bias when Nemotron-PII artifacts require it.

### Changed

- **`method="replace"` upgraded in place** to use the new Faker-backed `Anonymizer`. Surrogates are now locale-aware (e.g. German names for `lang="de"`, Portuguese phones for `lang="pt"`), format-preserving, and optionally deterministic. The previous tiny static `LANGUAGE_FAKE_DATA` lists are kept as a deprecated fallback used only when a Faker locale is unavailable.
- **Privacy filter book demo** (`examples/privacy_filter_book/app.py`) migrated to `PrivacyFilterTorchPipeline` for the CPU side, replacing the inline `AutoTokenizer`/`AutoModelForTokenClassification`/`pipeline` triple.
- **MLX inference module** trimmed: BIOES Viterbi (≈280 lines) and span-refinement helpers moved to `openmed.core.decoding`. Behavior unchanged.
- **Privacy Filter Studio** keeps model loading cache-only unless downloads are explicitly allowed, then restores the caller's Hugging Face offline environment after loading.
- **OpenMed Scan Demo privacy-filter option** now points at `OpenMed/privacy-filter-nemotron-mlx-8bit` and labels the engine as OpenAI Nemotron Privacy Filter throughout the picker, download events, and README.

### Breaking Changes

- **`faker>=22.0` is now a required core dependency**. Slim installs that skip the ML extras will still pull Faker (~3 MB).
- **`method="replace"` outputs no longer come from the prior hardcoded list** (`["Jane Smith", "John Doe", "Alex Johnson", "Sam Taylor"]`, etc.). Any test or downstream code asserting on those exact strings must either pass `consistent=True, seed=<value>` and update expected output, or assert non-equality with the original. All other methods (`mask`, `remove`, `hash`, `shift_dates`) are unchanged.
- **Privacy-filter routing through `extract_pii()`** skips regex smart-merging by design. Users who previously chained the low-level MLX pipeline with `merge_entities_with_semantic_units()` manually may see different entity counts; the new path produces cleaner spans because the model's Viterbi decoder already enforces BIOES validity.

### Tests

- New tests across `tests/unit/core/test_labels.py` (102), `tests/unit/core/test_anonymizer.py` (171, includes per-locale checksum validation across 100s of generated IDs), `tests/unit/test_privacy_filter_routing.py` (22 — backend selection, family-aware Torch fallback, dispatch, integration), Nemotron parametrisation of the existing privacy-filter MLX dispatch test (`tests/unit/mlx/test_privacy_filter_mlx.py::test_dispatches_privacy_filter_pipeline`), and Portuguese obfuscation regressions in `tests/unit/test_pii_multilingual_regression.py` (3).
- Swift OpenMedKit coverage for `classifier_bias` / `unembedding_bias` config decoding, Nemotron-biased Privacy Filter forward shape, and the baseline bias-less head.
- Focused privacy/anonymization suite: 458 passed, 6 skipped, 11 pre-existing span-validation warnings.

### Fixed

- Smart semantic-merge resolution no longer lets weaker model labels overwrite stronger validated pattern labels
- Localized Dutch, Hindi, and Telugu month-name parsing now falls back correctly during date shifting instead of relying only on `dateutil`
- Dutch phone, BSN, and street-address patterns were tightened after live smoke review to reduce overlap and improve entity labeling
