# Clinical Domain Label Catalog

**Disclaimer:** This catalog is generated from the packaged zero-shot domain label map and canonical label metadata. Labels, policy classes, risk levels, coding system hints, and fixture pointers are for offline evaluation and review workflow planning only; they are not clinical guidance and must not be used to infer diagnosis, treatment, coding, or coverage decisions.

## Immunization

**Alignment:** The display labels are shaped for the planned OM-138 FHIR Immunization exporter: VaccineName maps to vaccineCode, DoseNumber to protocolApplied.doseNumber[x], AdministrationRoute to route, AdministrationSite to site, VaccineLot to lotNumber, AdministrationDate to occurrence[x], and VaccineSeries to protocolApplied.series. This is extraction metadata only; it does not create exporter, recommendation, dosing, or scheduling logic.
