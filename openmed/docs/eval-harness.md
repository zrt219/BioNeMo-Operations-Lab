# Eval Harness & Metrics

`run_benchmark` executes a model over a sequence of `BenchmarkFixture` objects and returns a
`BenchmarkReport` whose `metrics` dict contains the standard OM-018 metric bundle.

## Metric Bundle

| Metric | Path | Gating? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Latency p50 | `latency.p50_ms` | No | Median steady-state fixture latency in ms. |
| Latency p95 | `latency.p95_ms` | No | 95th-percentile steady-state fixture latency in ms. |
| Latency count | `latency.count` | No | Number of steady-state fixtures (excludes cold start). |
| Cold-start latency | `latency.cold_start_ms` | No | Wall-clock latency of the first fixture call in ms. |
| Peak RSS | `resources.peak_rss_bytes` | No | Peak resident set size in bytes during the run. |

## Edge Metrics

### cold_start_ms

The harness records the wall-clock latency of the **first** fixture call separately. The default
runner keeps a shared model loader for the duration of the benchmark run, so that first call encloses
model and tokenizer loading plus the first forward pass. Later fixture calls reuse the warmed loader
and feed the steady-state latency summary. The value is surfaced at:

```
report.metrics['latency']['cold_start_ms']
```

It is **excluded** from the steady-state `p50_ms`, `p95_ms`, and `count` values.

!!! note "Reported, not gating"
    `cold_start_ms` does not participate in any release gate. It is an observability metric
    intended to track model-load overhead over time — not a pass/fail criterion.

```python
report = run_benchmark(fixtures, suite="my-suite", model_name="my-model", runner=runner)
cold_ms = report.metrics["latency"]["cold_start_ms"]
print(f"Cold-start latency: {cold_ms:.1f} ms")
```
