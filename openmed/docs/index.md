# OpenMed Documentation

OpenMed bundles curated biomedical models, advanced de-identification,
multimodal intake, structured health-data utilities, and one-call
orchestration so you can ship clinical NLP workflows without wrangling
infrastructure. This documentation keeps copied snippets and workflows close
at hand: each section is Markdown-first, searchable, and optimized for quick
scanning or copy/paste into notebooks.

OpenMed `1.8.1` carries the v1.8 cross-platform clinical data platform forward
with an architecture-safe PyTorch attention-selection hotfix:

- **Policy-aware de-identification** with signed audit reports, reproducibility
  hashes, review bundles, redaction previews, and release gates.
- **Multimodal and structured inputs** across OCR, images, PDFs, DOCX, EPUB,
  vCard/iCalendar, DICOM, CSV/TSV, JSONL chat logs, HL7 v2, CDA/C-CDA, FHIR
  operations, and FHIR Bulk NDJSON.
- **Python, Swift, Kotlin/Android, REST, gRPC, React Native, TypeScript, and
  browser paths** including OpenMedKit, typed REST clients, ONNX/WebGPU, and
  Transformers.js export bundles.
- **17 supported PII language codes: ar, de, en, es, fr, he, hi, id, it, ja,
  ko, nl, pt, ro, te, th, and tr** in the model-backed allow-list, with
  locale-aware validation and surrogate generation, plus additional
  validator-backed national-ID coverage for ID-only locales.
- **Release evidence** for leakage heatmaps, model scorecards, threshold
  sweeps, k-anonymity/l-diversity/t-closeness, utility loss, SBOMs, signed
  images, SLSA provenance, secret scanning, and reproducible dependency locks.

## What you get

- **Curated registries** – discoverable Hugging Face models with metadata (domain, size, device guidance).
- **One-line orchestration** – `analyze_text` wraps validation, inference, and formatting for scripts, notebooks, or services.
- **PII detection & de-identification** – HIPAA-aware smart entity merging,
  policy profiles, signed audit reports, and production-ready de-identification.
- **Apple Silicon and mobile acceleration** – MLX-backed Python inference plus Swift-native and Android/Kotlin app integration through OpenMedKit.
- **REST service** – FastAPI endpoints for `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/analyze`,
  `/pii/extract`, `/pii/deidentify`, warm pools, batching, metrics, and
  typed Python/TypeScript clients.
- **Browser and React Native export** – ONNX/WebGPU bundles for Transformers.js token
  classification in browser runtimes plus a React Native bridge for mobile apps.
- **Advanced NER post-processing** – score-aware grouping, PHI-friendly filtering, and CSV/JSON/HTML export helpers.
- **Composable config** – `OpenMedConfig` reads YAML/ENV so deployments stay reproducible across laptops and clusters.

!!! tip "Copy-friendly defaults"
    Every page in this site exposes code fences with copy buttons and callouts so teammates (or AI copilots) can lift the
    exact snippet they need. Use the search shortcut (`/` or `cmd/ctrl + K`) to jump straight to an entity, API call,
    or API surface.

## First look

```python
from openmed import analyze_text

result = analyze_text(
    "Patient started on imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia.",
    model_name="disease_detection_superclinical",
    confidence_threshold=0.55,
)

for entity in result.entities:
    print(entity.label, entity.text, entity.confidence)
```

```bash
uv pip install "openmed[hf]"
uv run python examples/pii_model_comparison.py
```

The rest of the docs expand on this snippet—head to **Quick Start** for the end-to-end setup, then explore the guides for
configuration, zero-shot GLiNER workflows, and advanced processing helpers.
