"""Standalone FHIR R4 CodeableConcept builder for a single coded entity.

Callers frequently have a single (system, code, display, text) tuple — e.g.
from a comparator adapter or a hand-coded mapping — and want a correctly shaped
FHIR ``CodeableConcept`` without going through grounding or the Athena index.

Two public entry points are exposed:

* :func:`coding` builds one ``{"system", "code", "display"}`` Coding dict from
  a vocabulary id (or already-canonical URI) plus a code string.
* :func:`codeable_concept` wraps one or more Codings into a ``CodeableConcept``
  dict, ordering them deterministically by a configurable system priority.

The canonical SYSTEM_URI map is the **single source of truth** for vocabulary
id → HL7 system URI mapping across OpenMed. Import :func:`system_uri` when you
need a canonical URI but not the full ``CodeableConcept`` machinery.

Out of scope: looking up codes against an Athena index or grounding. This module is the lower-level, purely mechanical
helper that higher-level builders can delegate to.
