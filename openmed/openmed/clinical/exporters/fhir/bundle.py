"""Assemble exported FHIR resources into a deterministic R4 transaction Bundle.

Per-resource exporters emit standalone resources (``Condition``,
``Observation``, ``DiagnosticReport``, ...). A FHIR server, however, ingests a
single transaction *Bundle*, and the resources inside it must cross-reference
one another through the Bundle (``Condition.subject`` -> Patient,
``DiagnosticReport.result`` -> Observation, ``Observation.encounter`` ->
Encounter).

:func:`to_bundle` wraps a document's resources into a valid R4 Bundle:

* every resource is given a stable ``urn:uuid`` ``fullUrl`` (seeded by
  ``doc_id`` + resource index, so the output is byte-stable across runs);
* every literal reference (``"ResourceType/id"``) that targets a resource
  present in the Bundle is rewritten to point at that resource's ``fullUrl``,
  so there are no dangling internal references;
* for ``transaction``/``batch`` bundles, each entry carries the ``request``
  block (``method``/``url``) a server needs to create the resource.
* exporters may pre-compute deterministic ``urn:uuid`` references via
  ``deterministic_fullurl(doc_id, index)``; those references survive
  Bundle assembly unchanged, while literal ``"ResourceType/id"``
  references continue to be rewritten when their targets are present
  in the Bundle;

The assembler is purely mechanical: it never synthesises resources (a Patient
removed by de-identification stays absent) and does not validate profiles.

    """Assemble ``resources`` into a single R4 Bundle.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resources:
        The standalone FHIR resources to wrap, in the order they should appear
        in the Bundle. Each must be a mapping carrying a ``resourceType``.
        Resources with an ``id`` must have a unique ``ResourceType/id`` within
        the Bundle; resources without an ``id`` are left unreferenceable.
    doc_id:
        Stable identifier for the source document. Together with the resource
        index it seeds the deterministic ``urn:uuid`` ``fullUrl`` of each
        entry, so the same input always produces byte-identical output.
    bundle_type:
        The Bundle ``type`` (defaults to ``"transaction"``). For
        ``transaction``/``batch`` bundles each entry also gets a ``request``
        block.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A ``resourceType=Bundle`` mapping with one entry per resource.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a resource lacks a ``resourceType``, or if two resources share the
        same ``resourceType`` and ``id``. Duplicate ids would silently
        overwrite one another in the internal reference map, corrupting
        cross-references, so they are rejected explicitly. Resources without
        an ``id`` remain valid (they are simply unreferenceable).
