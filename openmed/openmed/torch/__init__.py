"""PyTorch / HuggingFace Transformers backends for OpenMed.

This subpackage wraps token-classification models that run on PyTorch
(MPS, CUDA, or CPU) so they slot into the same OpenMed pipeline surface
as the MLX path. Use this when MLX is unavailable, or when you
intentionally choose the Hugging Face/PyTorch backend.
