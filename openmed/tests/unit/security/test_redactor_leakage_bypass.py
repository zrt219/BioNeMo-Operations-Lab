"""Leakage-bypass abuse-case suite for the de-identification redactor.

This suite is the executable half of the redactor threat model in
``docs/security/threat-model.md``. The tests drive mitigated abuse classes
through the *real* OpenMed de-identification surfaces and assert the identifier
is caught. The current public tests intentionally omit actionable reproductions
for known, unmitigated classes and route future findings through
``SECURITY.md``.

Hard rules honored here:

- **Synthetic identifiers only.** No real PHI/PII. Numbers are constructed to be
  structurally valid (checksums) but do not belong to any real person, matching
  the fixtures already used in ``tests/unit/core/test_safety_sweep.py``.
- **Offline.** No network and no model download. The deterministic layers
  (``normalize_for_pii_detection`` -> ``safety_sweep``) need no model. Where the
  end-to-end ``deidentify`` path is exercised, the ML detector is mocked to a
  *blind* detector that finds nothing, which is the strongest test: it proves the
  redactor's promise holds on deterministic structured identifiers even when the
  model fails completely.
- **Leakage-first.** Assertions check that the raw identifier does **not** survive
  in the output, not merely that "some" entity was found.
